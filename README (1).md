# 🌎 Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard

### 📊 Power BI Real-Time Project

---

## 🧭 **Project Overview**

The **Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** report that analyzes air quality across multiple cities, focusing on key pollutants and environmental indicators.
It enables policymakers, environmental analysts, and urban planners to **track pollution trends**, identify **hotspots**, and make **data-driven decisions** for improving air quality.

## 🎯 **Project Objectives**

* Monitor and compare **air quality levels** across cities.
* Track **year-wise pollution trends** to identify improvement or decline.
* Evaluate key pollutants contributing to poor air quality.
* Help policymakers design **targeted environmental policies**.
* Provide a clear, data-driven understanding of **AQI dynamics**.

## 🧩 **Dashboard Structure & Visual Elements**

### 🟩 **1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

| KPI                              | Description                                | Environmental Impact                                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Average CO (Carbon Monoxide)** | Measures CO concentration in ppm.          | High CO reduces oxygen delivery to body tissues.    |
| **Average NO (Nitrogen Oxides)** | Indicates NO and NO₂ levels.               | Leads to smog formation and acid rain.              |
| **Average SO₂ (Sulfur Dioxide)** | Tracks SO₂ emissions.                      | Causes respiratory problems and acid rain.          |
| **Average PM2.5**                | Measures fine particulate matter < 2.5 µm. | Penetrates lungs and bloodstream; high health risk. |

These KPIs provide a snapshot of **environmental health** for each city.

### 🟦 **2. Visual Components**

* **📈 Line Chart – Average AQI by Year:**
  Displays AQI trends over time to spot improvements or deteriorations in air quality.

  > *Example:* “AQI levels improved in 2023 across major cities due to stricter pollution policies.”

* **📊 Bar Chart – Top 5 Polluted Cities:**
  Highlights cities with the highest pollution levels.

  > *Insight:* “City X and City Y consistently rank as most polluted due to industrial emissions.”

* **📉 Bar Chart – Least Polluted Cities:**
  Displays cities with the lowest pollution levels — indicating successful air quality initiatives.

  > *Insight:* “Cities with high green cover show significantly lower AQI values.”

* **🎛️ Slicers:**

  * **City Name Filter:** View AQI metrics for specific cities.
  * **Year Filter:** Compare air quality between different years.

---

## 🔍 **Trends & Insights**

* **🌤️ Improvement Over Time:** Several cities show a downward trend in AQI levels, indicating better air quality.
* **⚠️ Pollution Hotspots:** Industrial and densely populated cities remain key contributors to poor air quality.
* **💨 PM2.5 Dominance:** Fine particulate matter emerges as the most persistent pollutant nationwide.
* **🌿 Environmental Success Stories:** Cities with strong environmental policies show clear declines in NO and SO₂ levels.

---

## 🧠 **Actionable Recommendations**

* **High-PM2.5 Cities:** Implement stricter industrial and vehicular emission standards.
* **CO Reduction:** Encourage electric public transport and fuel quality improvement.
* **SO₂ Control:** Promote cleaner energy sources and phase out coal-based industries.
* **Public Awareness:** Educate citizens on the impact of household burning and open waste fires.
* **Urban Planning:** Expand green spaces and use air-purifying vegetation in urban design.
